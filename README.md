# angular-seed

This is a seed application to get started on an Angular 1.x project with all the common libraries and tools involved in an Angular application.

I decided to try and make this work without grunt or gulp, using only npm packages. For linting, use watch 'jshint .'. For karma test runner, just use karma start.

On the Angular side, there is a sample controller, element directive, and factory.
