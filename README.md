# angular-seed

This is a seed application to get started on an Angular 1.x project with all the common libraries and tools involved in an Angular application using NPM packages for UI Router, Bootstrap, Smart Tables, Karma, Jasmine, and JSHint. This is still a work in progress, but I am trying to use only npm scripts (no grunt or gulp) to reduce dependencies to only NPM and basic shell commands.

On the Angular side, there is tempalted code for a sample controller, element directive, and factory.

Linting: From the project root, run watch 'jshint .'
Karma: Run karma start

TODO: 
  Live browser reload on changes
  Inject script files into index.html and karma.conf.js

For linting, use watch 'jshint .'. 
For karma test runner, just use karma start.
